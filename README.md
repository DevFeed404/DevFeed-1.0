## DevFeed: Newsletter Website ðŸ’Œ

**Welcome to DevFeed!** It's a newsletter website that enables users to subscribe and receive newsletters. The application is built with two main components:

**Client-Side Frontend (React.js):** The frontend of DevFeed is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. With React.js, we ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the website.

**Server-Side Backend (Node.js):** The backend of DevFeed is powered by Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js enables us to handle server-side logic, manage user subscriptions, and send out newsletters efficiently. It provides a robust foundation for building scalable and performant web applications.

By combining the frontend and backend components, DevFeed creates a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily subscribe to newsletters and receive the latest updates right in their inbox.
